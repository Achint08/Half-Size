Effective Dimensionality Reduction for Word Embeddings.

Code for the [arXiv paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5e5stq1Uz3yVDJOdE5VaHhPSDA/view?usp=sharing).

The word-vector evaluation code is directly used from https://github.com/mfaruqui/eval-word-vectors.  

Run the script algo.py (embedding location is hardcoded as of now).
